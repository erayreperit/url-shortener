## **Setting up the project**

First, you need to get the connection URI of your MongoDB database.
You can look [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/connection-string/) to learn how to get it.

Afterwards, go to [.env](/.env) and paste your connection URI.

## **Starting**

Type these commands into console: 
```bash
npm i # to install the dependencies
npm run build # to build the project
npm run dev # to start the project
```

And then, enjoy your URL shortener! :3
